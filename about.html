         <hr>
         <p>My name is Henry Huynh, and I was born and raised in the Silicon Valley. With a natural inclination for systematic and logical thinking, I consistently approach my work with precision and organization. As an exceptionally conscientious worker, I understand the significance of implementing systematic processes and ensuring the seamless operation of all project components.
         <br><br>
         Throughout my engineering career at A&D Precision, Inc., I have remained acutely aware of the potential impact even the smallest miscalculation can have on established organizational processes. As a Quality Process Engineer, I have successfully assessed procedure plans, implemented measures to enhance efficiency, conducted comprehensive and reliable quality checks, collaborated with diverse teams to bring profitable projects to fruition, and generated tangible and impactful results that can be effectively documented and presented.
         <br><br>
         I possess a strong work ethic, a well-honed engineering skillset encompassing manufacturing, quality control, and Full Stack Development. My experience and expertise in these areas allow me to effectively handle multiple tasks concurrently while maintaining high standards of performance. I am driven by an unwavering desire to enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge.
         <br><br>
         Drawing from my academic journey at San Jose State University and my industry experience as a Quality Process Engineer and Associate Test Engineer, I am committed to further refining my abilities. I strive to continuously learn, grow, and contribute to the success of future projects and organizations.</p>
