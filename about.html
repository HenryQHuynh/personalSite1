         <hr>
         <p>My name is Henry Huynh, I and was born and raised in the Silicon Valley. I am naturally a systematic thinker and can always be relied upon to be precise and organized in my work. I am an exceptionally conscientious worker who understands the importance of systematic processes and ensuring that all aspects of a project are running smoothly.
         <br><br>
         Ever since I began my engineering career at A&D Precision, Inc. I have always remained aware that the tiniest miscalculation could wreak havoc on an organizationâ€™s established processes. My experience as a Quality Process Engineer has allowed me to examine procedure plans and implement steps to improve efficiency, conduct in-depth and reliable quality checks, coordinate with various teams to bring projects to life, and generate fruitful results that could easily be cataloged and presented.
         <br><br>
         I have a strong work ethic, a trained engineering skillset in manufacturing and Full Stack Development, the ability to handle multiple tasks, and a desire to improve my skills and expand my knowledge. Between my academic career at San Jose State University and my industry knowledge as a Quality Process Engineer and Associate Test Engineer, I hope to continue to hone my skills.</p>
